# Summer Chores Assignment

I had to create a Node.js project which simulates someone doing their summer chores — with a chance of falling asleep from exhaustion. In this assignment I demonstrated callback functions, promises, and async/await in JavaScript.

## Chore Task
1. Mow the yard
2. Weed eat
3. Trim hedges
4. Collect wood
5. Water the garden

## Versions Established

- ✅ `callbackVersion.js` - Uses callbacks
- ✅ `promiseVersion.js` - Uses Promises with `.then()`
- ✅ `asyncAwaitVersion.js` - Uses async/await for clean async control flow

## How to Run

You are able to runa any version using Node:

```bash
node callbackVersion.js
node promiseVersion.js
node asyncAwaitVersion.js
